### Hi there 👋 😄

- 🔭 I’m studying in Northeastern University
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my intern now, developing software with JS, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, GCP and Raspberry Pi.
- 👓 I'm now learning Rust in my spare time.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some C++/JS/Rust pojects
- 💬 Happy to discuss me about IoT, Game Dev, sensors...
- ⚡ Fun fact: Love C++, rust and learn to build OS now.
